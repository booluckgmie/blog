All those who contributed to the congress: Thank you for all your excellent work!

It is fair to conclude that the congress was a great success! I believe that many people have contributed in so many ways to turn this event into a smoothly running meeting with many very interesting presentations and posters and a very good atmosphere for discussion and networking. Kudus to ISI-WSC 2019 Secretariat for selecting Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre (KLCC) as the fabulous venue for organizing the first ISI-World Statistics Congress in Malaysia. ISI WSC 2019 Local Organisers has done a great job in hosting the ISI-WSC Congress 2019. The congress was very well organized. They have worked very professionally in registering all participants, interacting with them on many details, organizing many aspects of the congress such as time coordination, logistics and programme contents. The program structure as well as the information given by eminent academics from different fields was excellent and very useful especially for the new as well as experienced research expert of the area. I would like to express my gratitude to the organizing committee for the congress.

I would like to convey my sincere gratitude and thanks to the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) for providing me extremely useful and enlightening opportunity to attend the 62nd ISI-World Statistics Congress in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and feel privileged to meet and share with so many distinguished intellectuals. I enjoyed, learnt and liked every session and the whole gamut of the ISI-WSC Congress 2019. It was indeed a successful congress and I felt very proud and honoured to be part of ISI-WSC Crew and participant of such a standard International congress; it has opened altogether a new era in my academic life and statistician profession!

For all of these, I would like to express my gratitude to the Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) and also for considering my application for financial support to attending Short Courses/ Main Congress of the 62nd ISI WSC 2019 which helped me to participate in this prestigious event.

Besides, personally speaking it was a very useful opportunity for young researchers like me, who are going to start their work in the very vast area of data science. The congress was indeed an excellent occasion for researchers around the world to come together and share their research in field of data science. I also learned a great deal from numerous innovative studies presented at the congress. I can incorporate to enhance my understanding as well as to strengthen my research. I am grateful to the ISI-WSC Congress 2019 for providing me with such a great opportunity and such a unique experience that transformed my perception of data science research, enriched me with the knowledge of new methods and techniques and help me strengthen the areas for my research. There is no doubt that the congress provided an opportunity for participants to take some time out and think and reflect. The opportunity for discussion and dialogue that this congress provided needs to continue and be built on. 

I personally feel it is important not to lose threads of conversation that had been started; at least the young participants were obviously keen to explore the detail of collaboration and collaborative research in near future. I am willing to help in any way I can, and willing to be part of the planning group which could enhance my practical knowledge and understanding of data science in future.

> Thank you again and see you at 63rd ISI World Statistics Congress 2021, in The Hague, The Netherlands.
