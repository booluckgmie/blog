It is recommended that the organization to ask, "What is the value I want to get from my information, and what is the right tool for that job?". The decision will depend on budget, size of organization, and what the database will be used for. Consider the budget, who will be using and maintaining the database, and what tasks they will perform with it.  If you have complex requirements, you may opt for a server platform. If budget and ease of use is an issue, a desktop database may be more suitable for the needs. If we are looking for more flexibility and openness, then a web-enabled database, may suit the needs better. 

## What Are the Key Differences Between Open & Closed Source Software?
Generally, the key differentiators between open and closed come down to a few factors:
1.	Cost
2.	Service
3.	Innovation
4.	Usability
5.	Security

There are pros and cons of each and the direction you head in, will largely depend on our priorities for each of these 5 factors. Those priorities will help dictate when itâ€™s appropriate to use open source and when to use a closed source CMS.

The key pros and cons of open vs closed source software largely depend on the technical expertise and resources available to maintain and update the software. Consider the five points outlined in this article to get a better idea of the right software for the organization's needs now and in the future.

IT systems and infrastructure play a critical role in the success of census data collected with the use of electronic data collection technologies. To assure success, the IT systems and infrastructure, both individually and when integrated, need to perform and function as intended. It should be noted that a contingency plan should be developed for all possible risks. 

Every vendor offers different security options, but it should be using data encryption, which scrambles data as it is stored in the databases so that anyone without the decryption key will only see a scrambled version of the data. If term of security, it is better to deploy on enterprise database rather open source.
