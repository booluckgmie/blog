Malaysia has a tropical climate with a temperature ranging between 25°C and 35°C that is influenced by two monsoon seasons: southwest and northeast. The southwest monsoon typically occurs from May to August, and the northeast monsoon occurs from November until February. As the monsoon season changes, the amount of rainfall and temperature during the period has intense impact on water resources, agriculture, economics, and ecosystems in the country. It is of significant concern that during the period of Northeast monsoon, the heavy rainfall event affects the eastern and southern region the most resulting to high discharge level, which possibly leads to occurrence of flood events. This is when statistics come in handy. By utilizing the suitable statistical techniques, we are able to identify the river flow pattern so that we can understand and characterize the hydrological process during monsoon season to be well aware of the flood occurrence pattern.

One of statistical technique that can be utilized is `Cluster analysis`. Cluster analysis provides a statistical technique in order to group hydrological data based on historical observations to reveal underlying pattern. To identify the river flow pattern, one-way clustering method has been widely used by hydrologists to extract information from historical river flow data. In addition, changes in river flow pattern are always reflected by the change of climate. During northeast monsoon period, the high level of discharge recorded are mainly due to high level of rainfall distribution. This phenomenon is well understood in `hydrology`, whereas if the discharge level is high, there is also the tendency for the occurrence of a flood event. Therefore, the discharge records can be clustered to identify the homogeneous river flow pattern during northeast monsoon using hierarchical clustering algorithm.

## Modernizing Malaysia
River flow information are important in defining availability of water supply, evaluation of flood control, used in irrigation process, source of hydropower plant, etc. In Malaysia, reliable river flow information can be compromised by incomplete information due to the existence of many ungauged catchments (Razaqa et al., 2016). Thus, identification of group of hydrologically similar catchment is useful to ensure transferability of information when applying region classification.

Other than cluster analysis, forecasting also can be utilized. Malaysia has experienced major flood events in numerous years specifically in the state of Johor (Chan, 2015). The flood events are usually coincides to above-normal level in river flows (Shook, 2016). In providing protection of possible flood events, forecasting of river flow is one of the approaches used as it helps water resource management to provide insight of unforeseeable event in the future (Yaseen et al., 2016). For forecasting or predicting purpose, streamflow historical time series data obtained at regular intervals can be used to predict future patterns based on the observation of past patterns. This can be done by first classify the streamflow pattern. The information of classification is then further used to forecast the river flow and this kind of methodology have been applied in India (Gupta et al., 2013, Mishra et al., 2015), China (Ouyang et al., 2010) and Hungary (Luna et al., 2005).

The identification of homogeneous river flow pattern plays an important role in hydrology to support various water management policies purposes (McCabe & Wolock, 2014). These help in identifying and characterizing similar rivers into manageable units, within which environmental flow guidelines could be implemented (Alba Solans et. al., 2013). These homogeneous pattern are normally classified into two categories with respect to region and time period. For instance, river classification may provide the classes of similar river basins for developing ecological standards on groups rather than river-by-river basis (Oden et. al., 2012).

In addition, it also can reduce some impacts in term of financial and properties to the public since the government has been spending large amounts of money and flood mitigation projects. More or less, the information on river flow characteristics can provide Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID) and Malaysian Meteorological Department in providing some insight for actions to be implemented in future. 

> Holistically, without help of statistical techniques, all the hidden information cannot be extracted. Hence, no actions or decision can be taken to prevent the flood event and to be prepared for the coming flood event to be occurred.
