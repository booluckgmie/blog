The current situation of the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia has caused the Government to re-impose the Movement Control Order (MCO 2.0) directive throughout the nationwide except Sarawak (when articles written) to curb the spread of the COVID-19.

As informed by Senior Minister of Defense on 20 January 2021, the implications of the current situation of the COVID-19 cases and the implementation of the MCO 2.0, DOSM will restructure its face-to-face interviews and re-open all its e-Census platform (Online Census).

## Statistics of Malaysia Census 2020
Based on the responses received until 21 January 2021, it is estimated that 23.2 million people or 70.9 percent of the estimated 32.7 million Malaysians have not yet filled the Malaysia Census 2020.

Therefore, residents who have not yet completed the census are urged to immediately fill in the online census information through www.mycensus.gov.my to jointly support the government's efforts in curbing the spread of COVID-19 among Malaysians.

The information provided will shape the lives of future generations.  The role and responsibility that must be borne by the government and the people is very important in ensuring the continued development of Malaysia in a competitive, integrity and dignified manner so that all citizens can achieve a decent standard of living.

Remember!! The pleasures of life that we enjoy today are the result of information provided by previous generations in a series of Censuses that have been implemented.
