The fast-spreading infection, a new respiratory virus first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan has infected. Wuhan - which has a population of 11 million people - has gone into lockdown, with authorities suspending flights and train services in and out of the city. 
The virus was first reported to the World Health Organization on `Dec. 31` and has been under investigation since. Chinese scientists have linked the disease to a family of viruses known as `coronaviruses`. Outside China, confirmed cases have been recorded in Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Nepal, Japan, the US, Australia, and France. Authorities are taking steps to guard against the spread of **2019-nCoV**. This outbreak - known as `novel coronaviru`s (nCoV) - is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.

## **Malaysia Novel Coronavirus Update**
Until January 26, 2020 - Out of the **23 cases** of PUI reported, there is only one positive `2019-nCoV` case of a 40-year-old Chinese citizen. Meanwhile, 18 cases of PUI were **negative** `(12 Malaysians, 5 Chinese and 1 Jordanian)` and had been discharged from the hospital. Considering the current situation, MOH continues to improve the prevention and control of the Novel Coronavirus infection outbreak. The MOH would also like to advise people who plan to visit China to postpone their travel except for important matters that cannot be avoided. 

> **How worried are the experts?**
Prof Ball says: "We should be worried about any virus that explores humans for the first time, because it's overcome the first major barrier.You don't want to give the virus the opportunity."

## How worried should Malaysian are?
To answer that, we have performed simple analysis via different platforms as such:
** 1. Google Trends**: to measure and compare how often people are searching for certain terms or topics on Google

** 2. Tweet Sentiment Visualization**: to estimate and visualize sentiment

The visual features assigned to a circle to represent its tweet's estimated sentiment: colour—blue for unpleasant, green for pleasant; brightness—brighter for more aroused; size and transparency—larger and more opaque for more confidence in the sentiment estimate

** 3. Sentiment Analysis Tool for Twitter** (`Twitter Crawler in the Python code`): 
Within the social chatter being generated every second, there are vast amounts of hugely valuable insights waiting to be extracted. Twitter Crawler allows us to scrape tweets and store the tweets into a csv. then analyzes sentiments for tweets about “coronavirus in Malaysia”.

## Should we panic?
No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. Our analysis estimate that Malaysian remain calm and always be alert for possible early signs of coronavirus. The health authorities in Malaysia already enforce strict checks at the entry points, especially for those who have been to China, to prevent the spread of the Wuhan virus. 
Keep hygiene, invest in health, eat healthy food and exercise well.
